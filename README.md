# Kolkata_Data_PMC_paper_TrafficCountEstimationUsingCrowdSourcedTrajectory
This release contains the raw data that are used in the paper titled [Traffic count estimation using crowd-sourced trajectory data in the absence of dedicated infrastructure](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmcj.2024.101935). 

The raw trajectory data interpreted camera data with signal timing information, traffic counts and queue lengths data were collected at a single-lane signalised road intersection at the Webel-More in Kolkata. Validation datasets are manually collected using a video camera installed at the observer's location. A ground-truth dataset of vehicle counts, departure headways, and signal timing is manually constructed using time-stamped video camera footage and visual inspection. A smartphone-equipped vehicle with the GPSlogger Android application is used to collect the set of vehicle trajectory data.
